# Generalized Edit Based Similairty (Distance) Functions for Comparing Strings

### 

I derived a generalized similarity function for various edit distance functions. This seems to be perform quite well.

### Edit Distance 

Edit distance between two string is typically defined as number of addition, deletion, insertion, transpose etc of characters. Some of the popular 
edit distace functions are hamming distance, Levenshitein distance, Levenshtein Ratio, damerauLevenshtein, Jaro Winkler distance etc. 
Below I propose variations of these edit distance functions which are called generalzied distance fuctions. Analysis on some of mst mispelled words, and homonyms (similar spelled but different in meaning)
shows the generalzied distance metrics are generally better than original counterparts.
